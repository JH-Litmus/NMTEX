Procedure:
 10 mCi of Tc-99m pertechnetate was intravenously injected. Dynamic images of the salivary glands were obtained before and after the gustatory stimulation.

Findings:
 Decreased uptake in bilateral parotid glands with relatively normal excretion function.
 No remarkable finding in bilateral submandibular glands.
 

Impression:
 Decreased uptake function of bilateral PGs.
